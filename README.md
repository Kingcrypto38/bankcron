# moov-io/bankcron
Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

`bankcron` is a wrapper around typical bash/shell commands to only run them on banking days. This is useful for processes which should only run on days when federal banks are open.
